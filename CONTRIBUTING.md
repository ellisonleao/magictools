How to contribute
-----------------

To keep things organized, we need to set a few basic rules in order for you to start contributing:

- Always keep the list in alphabetical order when adding a new item
- For new sections, please add a issue *BEFORE* open a pull request. In that way we can discuss first.
- Please don't send pull requests for deprecated packages. Let's keep this list updated with the latest projects and tools.
- Before open a pull request, please keep your local branch updated with the latest HEAD.

Thank you for your contribution and let's keep growing!
